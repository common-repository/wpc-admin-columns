WPC Admin Columns offers a listing of columns in the admin dashboards for different post types.

== Description ==

Managing an online store on WordPress is made easier with the **WPC Admin Columns** plugin. This plugin offers a listing of columns in the admin dashboards for different post types so you can adjust the columns’ width, quickly find the ones to be edited, and easily preview the details in a glance.

A variety of data and parameters will be displayed for faster preview of different post types - products, posts, pages, and especially, orders. For example, instead of choosing a filter to find a specific product type, now users can see which type each product belongs to with the “Product type” column. It’s super helpful to detect special product types namely Smart Bundles/ Smart Composite & Smart Grouped.

The most remarkable feature in this plugin is the custom columns for products and orders. In the content of these custom columns, it’s possible to insert texts and shortcode. There’s also a Remove button for each custom column to be left out of the column list effortlessly. With this, shop owners and administrators can literally display any piece of information they want in the backend dashboard.

= Default Columns =

WordPress allows users to check/uncheck the columns they want to display or hide from the Screen Options menu. However, it’s time consuming when you need to modify more data at the same time and very annoying to open that menu several times.

WPC Admin Columns helps you go further by listing all columns in one popup so they can grab the information in an instance. Default columns will be listed on top of each list:

- Products: Image, Name, SKU, Stock, Price, Categories, Tags, Featured, Date
- Orders: Order, Date, Status, Billing, Ship To, Total, Actions, Latest Note, Note
- Pages: Title, Author, Comments, Date
- Posts: Title, Author, Categories, Tags, Comments, Date

= Management of Products & Orders =

By default, WooCommerce only shows some of the product details in the Products dashboard. Our plugin makes it more straightforward for shop owners and administrators to preview products’ type, status, description, short description, weight, length, width, height, dimensions besides basic information namely product ID & name.

For orders, users are entitled to not just preview basic information such as Order, Date, Status, Billing, Ship To, Total, Actions, Latest Note, Note. There is an individual column exclusive for notes created by the WPC Order Notes for WooCommerce plugin. Clicking on the icon under the Notes column then the popup will be opened for users to preview all existing notes & add a new one if they want.

= Work in the WPClever Ecosystem =

It also means this plugin is fully tested on any of our WPC themes so users can expect smooth performance if they use any of our themes for the online store.

Under these columns, users can click on the icon to access the Quick Edit popup and preview the settings. Saving time in managing your products & orders should be the very first step to higher success.
